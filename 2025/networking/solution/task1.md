#OSI MODEL 

the osi (open system interconnection )is the set of rules that explain how diffrent computer systems communicate over the internet.it is a thioretical model that explain that how data travels from one computer to another in seven layers.


# TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model)

It is a real-world model that is actually used in internet. 
<<<<<<< HEAD
It is simpler then OSI that is why we can browse websites,send emails, and use the internet .

It is simpler then OSI and is the reason we can browse websites,send emails,and use the internet.

# KEY DIFFRENCES;

OSI is a concept and TCP/IP is used in real network.
OSI has 7 layers and TCP/IP has 4 layers.
TCP/IP is faster and more practical then OSI.

# let's break each model and see how they relate to everyday activities.

# OSI MODEL: THE 7 LAYERS

1. Physical layer: 

2. Data link layer:

3. Network layer:

4. Transport layer:

5. Session layer:

6. Presentation layer:

7. Application layer:

# TCP/IP MODEL: THE 4 LAYERS

1. Network interface layer:

2. Internet layer: 

3. Transport layer:

4. Application layer:

# REAL LIFE ANALOGY:Sending a letter

# Imagine you'r sending a physical letter:

1. Writting a letter:     (Application)

2. Enevelope and Addressing:     (Presentation)

3. Postal routing:     (Network)

4. Transportation:     (Physical)

In this analogy, each step ensure your letter reaches the right person, intact and readable, much like how data travels through the layers of these models to reach it's destination.
